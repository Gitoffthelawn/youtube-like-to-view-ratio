### youtube like to view ratio

This extension shows the like to view ratio for youtube videos.
A video with 1M views and 100 likes for example has a low ratio (0.1%), and probably means it does not worth your time.

Any video with a like to view ratio greater than 2 or 3 percent, should be all right.
The correct ratio however depends on the type of content you are watching.

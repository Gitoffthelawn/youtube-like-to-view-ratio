### youtube like to view ratio

Youtube recently removed the dislike to like ratio.  
A video with 1M views and 100 likes for example has a low ratio (0.1%), and probably means the video is not popular.

Any video with a like to view ratio greater than 2 or 3 percent, should be all right.
However the correct ratio depends on the type of content you are watching.
